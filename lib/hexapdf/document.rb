  # == HexaPDF::Document
  #
  # Represents a PDF document.
  #
  # A PDF document essentially consists of (indirect) objects, so the main job of this class is to
  # provide methods for working with these objects. However, since a PDF document may also be
  # incrementally updated and can therefore contain one or more revisions, there are also methods
  # for working with these revisions (see Revisions for details).
  #
  # Additionally, there are many convenience methods for easily accessing the most important PDF
  # functionality, like encrypting a document (#encrypt), working with digital signatures
  # (#signatures), accessing the interactive form data (#acro_form), working with the pages
  # (#pages), fonts (#fonts) and images (#images).
  #
  # Note: This class provides the basis for working with a PDF document. The higher PDF
  # functionality is *not* implemented here but either in the appropriate PDF type classes or in
  # special convenience classes. All this functionality can be accessed via the convenience methods
  # described above.
  #
  # == Available Message Hooks
  #
  # The document object provides a basic message dispatch system via #register_listener and
  # #dispatch_message.
  #
  # Following messages are used by HexaPDF itself:
  #
  # :complete_objects::
  #      This message is called before the first step of writing a document. Listeners should
  #      complete PDF objects that are missing some information.
  #
  #      For example, the font system uses this message to complete the font objects with
  #      information that is only available once all the used glyphs are known.
  #
  # :before_write::
  #      This message is called before a document is actually serialized and written.

    #
    # Depending on whether a block is provided, the functionality is different:
    #
    # * If no block is provided, the whole file is instantly read into memory and the PDF Document
    #   created for it is returned.
    #
    # * If a block is provided, the file is opened and a PDF Document is created for it. The
    #   created document is passed as an argument to the block and when the block returns the
    #   associated file object is closed. The value of the block will be returned.
    #
    # The block version is useful, for example, when you are dealing with a large file and you
    # only need a small portion of it.

    # When an IO object is provided and it contains an encrypted PDF file, it is automatically

    #     security handler expects a :password key to be set to either the user or owner password of

    #
    # The +obj+ argument can also be a HexaPDF::Object object so that it can be re-wrapped if
    # necessary.
    #
    # The class of the returned object is always a subclass of HexaPDF::Object (or of
    # HexaPDF::Stream if +stream+ is given). Which subclass is used, depends on the values of the
    # +type+ and +subtype+ options as well as on the 'object.type_map' and 'object.subtype_map'
    # global configuration options:
    #
    # * First +type+ is used to try to determine the class. If it is not provided and if +obj+ is a
    #   hash with a :Type field, the value of this field is used instead. If the resulting object is
    #   already a Class object, it is used, otherwise the type is looked up in 'object.type_map'.
    #
    # * If +subtype+ is provided or can be determined because +obj+ is a hash with a :Subtype or :S
    #   field, the type and subtype together are used to look up a special subtype class in
    #   'object.subtype_map'.
    #
    #   Additionally, if there is no +type+ but a +subtype+, all required fields of the subtype
    #   class need to have values; otherwise the subtype class is not used. This is done to better
    #   prevent invalid mappings when only partial knowledge (:Type key is missing) is available.
    #
    # * If there is no valid class after the above steps, HexaPDF::Stream is used if a stream is
    #   given, HexaPDF::Dictionary if the given object is a hash, HexaPDF::PDFArray if it is an
    #   array or else HexaPDF::Object.
    #
    # Options:
    #
    # :type:: (Symbol or Class) The type of a PDF object that should be used for wrapping. This
    #         could be, for example, :Pages. If a class object is provided, it is used directly
    #         instead of determining the class through the type detection system.
    #
    # :subtype:: (Symbol) The subtype of a PDF object which further qualifies a type. For
    #            example, image objects in PDF have a type of :XObject and a subtype of :Image.
    #
    # :oid:: (Integer) The object number that should be set on the wrapped object. Defaults to 0
    #        or the value of the given object's object number.
    #
    # :gen:: (Integer) The generation number that should be set on the wrapped object. Defaults to
    #        0 or the value of the given object's generation number.
    #
    # :stream:: (String or StreamData) The stream object which should be set on the wrapped
    #           object.
