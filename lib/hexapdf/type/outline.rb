  module Type

    # Represents the root of the PDF's document outline containing a hierarchy of outline items
    # (sometimes called bookmarks) in a linked list.
    #
    # The document outline usually contains items for the sections of the document, so that clicking
    # on an item opens the page where the section starts (the section header is). Most PDF viewers
    # are able to display the outline to aid in navigation, though not all apply the optional
    # attributes like the text color.
    #
    # The outline dictionary is linked via the /Outlines entry from the Type::Catalog and can
    # directly be accessed via HexaPDF::Document#outline.
    #
    # == Examples
    #
    # Here is an example for creating an outline:
    #
    #   doc = HexaPDF::Document.new
    #   5.times { doc.pages.add }
    #   doc.outline.add_item("Section 1", destination: 0) do |sec1|
    #     sec1.add_item("Page 2", destination: doc.pages[1])
    #     sec1.add_item("Page 3", destination: 2)
    #     sec1.add_item("Section 1.1", text_color: "red", flags: [:bold]) do |sec11|
    #       sec11.add_item("Page 4", destination: 3)
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # Here is one for copying the complete outline from one PDF to another:
    #
    #   doc = HexaPDF::Document.open(ARGV[0])
    #   target = HexaPDF::Document.new
    #   stack = [target.outline]
    #   doc.outline.each_item do |item, level|
    #     if stack.size < level
    #       stack << stack.last[:Last]
    #     elsif stack.size > level
    #       (stack.size - level).times { stack.pop }
    #     end
    #     stack.last.add_item(target.import(item))
    #   end
    #   # Copying all the pages so that the references work.
    #   doc.pages.each {|page| target.pages << target.import(page) }
    #
    # See: PDF1.7 s12.3.3
