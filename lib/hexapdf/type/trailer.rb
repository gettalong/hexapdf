    # Represents the PDF file trailer.
    #
    # The file trailer is the starting point for the PDF's object tree. It links to the Catalog
    # (the main PDF document structure) and the Info dictionary and holds the information
    # necessary for encrypting the PDF document.
    #
    # Since a PDF document can contain multiple revisions, each revision needs to have its own
    # file trailer (see HexaPDF::Revision#trailer).
    #
    # When cross-reference streams are used the information that is normally stored in the file
    # trailer is stored directly in the cross-reference stream dictionary. However, a
    # HexaPDF::Revision object's trailer dictionary is always of this type. Only when a
    # cross-reference stream is written is the trailer integrated into the stream's dictionary.
    #
    # See: PDF2.0 s7.5.5, s14.4; XRefStream
