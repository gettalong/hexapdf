      # Represents the PDF's interactive form dictionary. It is linked from the catalog dictionary
      # via the /AcroForm entry.
      #
      # == Overview
      #
      # An interactive form consists of fields which can be structured hierarchically and shown on
      # pages by using Annotations::Widget annotations. This means one field can have zero, one or
      # more visual representations on one or more pages. The fields at the bottom of the hierarchy
      # which have no parent are called "root fields" and are stored in /Fields.
      #
      # Each field in a form has a certain type which determines how it should be displayed and what
      # a user can do with it. The most common type is "text field" which allows the user to enter
      # one or more lines of text. There are also check boxes, radio buttons, list boxes and combo
      # boxes.
      #
      # == Visual Appearance
      #
      # The visual appearance of a field is normally provided by the application creating the PDF.
      # This is done by generating the so called appearances for all widgets of a field. However, it
      # is also possible to instruct the PDF reader application to generate the appearances on the
      # fly using the /NeedAppearances key, see #need_appearances!.
      #
      # HexaPDF uses the configuration option +acro_form.create_appearance_streams+ to determine
      # whether appearances should automatically be generated.
      #

        #   and every other string value is assigned as is. See ButtonField#field_value= for
