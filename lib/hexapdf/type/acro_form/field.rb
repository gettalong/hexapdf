    module AcroForm

      # AcroForm field dictionaries are used to define the properties of form fields of AcroForm
      # objects.
      #
      # Fields can be organized in a hierarchy using the /Kids and /Parent keys, for namespacing
      # purposes and to set default values. Those fields that have other fields as children are
      # called non-terminal fields, otherwise they are called terminal fields.
      #
      # While field objects can be created manually, it is best to use the various +create_+ methods
      # of the main Form object to create them so that all necessary things are set up correctly.
      #
      # == Field Types
      #
      # Subclasses are used to implement the specific AcroForm field types:
      #
      # * ButtonField implements the button fields (pushbuttons, check boxes and radio buttons)
      # * TextField implements single or multiline text fields.
      # * ChoiceField implements scrollable list boxes or (editable) combo boxes.
      # * SignatureField implements signature fields.
      #
      # == Field Flags
      #
      # Various characteristics of a field can be changed by setting a certain flag. Some flags are
      # defined for all types of field, some are specific to a certain type.
      #
      # The following flags apply to all fields:
      #
      # :read_only:: The field is read only which means the user can't change the value or interact
      #              with associated widget annotations.
      #
      # :required:: The field is required if the form is exported by a submit-form action.
      #
      # :no_export:: The field should *not* be exported by a submit-form action.
      #
      # == Field Type Implementation Notes
      #
      # If an AcroForm field type adds additional inheritable dictionary fields, it has to set the
      # constant +INHERITABLE_FIELDS+ to all inheritable dictionary fields, including those from the
      # superclass.
      #
      # Similarily, if additional flags are provided, the constant +FLAGS_BIT_MAPPING+ has to be set
      # to combination of the superclass value of the constant and the mapping of flag names to bit
      # indices.
      #
      # See: PDF2.0 s12.7.4.1
