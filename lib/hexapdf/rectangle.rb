  # Implementation of the PDF rectangle data structure.
  #
  # Rectangles are used for describing page and bounding boxes. They are represented by arrays of
  # four numbers specifying the (x,y) coordinates of *any* diagonally opposite corners.
  #
  # This class simplifies the usage of rectangles by automatically normalizing the coordinates so
  # that they are in the order:
  #
  #   [left, bottom, right, top]
  #
  # where +left+ is the bottom left x-coordinate, +bottom+ is the bottom left y-coordinate, +right+
  # is the top right x-coordinate and +top+ is the top right y-coordinate.
  #
  # See: PDF1.7 s7.9.5
