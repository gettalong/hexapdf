require 'hexapdf/layout'

module HexaPDF
  class Document

    # This class provides methods for working with classes in the HexaPDF::Layout module.
    #
    # Often times the layout related classes are used through HexaPDF::Composer which makes it easy
    # to create documents. However, sometimes one wants to have a bit more control or do something
    # special and use the HexaPDF::Layout classes directly. This is possible but it is better to use
    # those classes through an instance of this class because it makes it more convenient and ties
    # everything together. Incidentally, HexaPDF::Composer relies on this class for a good part of
    # its work.
    #
    #
    # == Boxes
    #
    # The main focus of the class is on providing convenience methods for creating box objects. The
    # most often used box classes like HexaPDF::Layout::TextBox or HexaPDF::Layout::ImageBox can be
    # created through dedicated methods:
    #
    # * #text_box
    # * #formatted_text_box
    # * #image_box
    # * #lorem_ipsum_box
    #
    # Other, more general boxes don't have their own method but can be created through the general
    # #box method. This method uses the 'layout.boxes.map' configuration option.
    #
    # Additionally, the +_box+ suffix can be omitted, so calling #text, #formatted_text and #image
    # also works. Furthermore, all box names defined in the 'layout.boxes.map' configuration option
    # can be used as method names (with or without a +_box+ suffix) and will invoke #box, i.e.
    # #column and #column_box will also work.
    #
    #
    # == Box Styles
    #
    # All box creation methods accept Layout::Style objects or names for style objects (defined via
    # #style). This allows one to predefine certain styles (like first level heading, second level
    # heading, paragraph, ...) and consistently use them throughout the document creation process.
    #
    # One style property, Layout::Style#font, is handled specially:
    #
    # * If no font is set on a style, the font "Times" is automatically set because otherwise there
    #   would be problems with text drawing operations (font is the only style property that has no
    #   valid default value).
    #
    # * Standard style objects only allow font wrapper objects to be set via the Layout::Style#font
    #   method. This class makes usage easier by allowing strings or an array [name, options_hash]
    #   to be used, like with e.g Content::Canvas#font. So to use Helvetica as font, one could just
    #   do:
    #
    #     style.font = 'Helvetica'
    #
    #   And if Helvetica in its bold variant should be used it would be:
    #
    #     style.font = ['Helvetica', variant: :bold]
    #
    #   Helvetica in bold could also be set the conventional way:
    #
    #     style.font = 'Helvetica bold'
    #
    #   However, using an array it is also possible to specify other options when setting a font,
    #   like the :subset option.
    #
    class Layout

      # This class is used when a box can contain child boxes and the creation of such boxes should
      # be seemlessly doable when creating the parent node. It is yieled, for example, by Layout#box
      # to collect the children for the created box.
      #
      # A box can be added to the list of collected children in the following ways:
      #
      # #<<:: This appends the given box to the list.
      #
      # text_box, formatted_text_box, image_box, ...:: Any method accepted by the Layout class.
      #
      # text, formatted_text, image, ...:: Any method accepted by the Layout class without the _box
      #                                    suffix.
      #
      # list, column, ...:: Any name registered with the configuration option +layout.boxes.map+.
      #
      # The special method #multiple allows adding multiple boxes as a single array to the collected
      # children.
      #
      # Example:
      #
      #   document.layout.box(:list) do |list|  # list is a ChildrenCollector
      #     list.text_box("Some text here")     # layout method
      #     list.image(image_path)              # layout method without _box suffix
      #     list.column(columns: 3) do |column| # registered box name
      #       column.text("Text in column")
      #       column << document.layout.lorem_ipsum_box   # adding a Box instance
      #     end
      #   end
      class ChildrenCollector

        # Creates a children collector, yields it and then returns the collected children.
        def self.collect(layout)
          collector = new(layout)
          yield(collector)
          collector.children
        end

        # The collected children
        attr_reader :children

        # instance.
        def initialize(layout)

      #
      # Creates or updates the Layout::Style object called +name+ with the given property values and
      # returns it.
      #
      # If neither +base+ nor any style properties are specified, the style +name+ is just returned.
      #
      # This method allows convenient access to the stored styles and to update them. Such styles
      # can then be used by name in the various box creation methods, e.g. #text_box or #image_box.
      #
      # If the style +name+ does not exist yet and the argument +base+ specifies the name of another
      # style, that style is duplicated and used as basis for the style. This also means that the
      # referenced +base+ style needs be defined first!
      #
      # The special name :base should be used for setting the base style which is used for the
      # +base+ argument when no specific style is specified.
      #
      # Note that the style property 'font' is handled specially, see the class documentation for
      # details.
      #
      # Example:
      #
      #   layout.style(:base, font_size: 12, leading: 1.2)
      #   layout.style(:header, font: 'Helvetica', fill_color: "008")
      #   layout.style(:header1, base: :header, font_size: 30)
      #
      # See: HexaPDF::Layout::Style
      def style(name, base: :base, **properties)
        style = @styles[name] ||= (@styles.key?(base) ? @styles[base].dup : HexaPDF::Layout::Style.new)
        style.update(**properties) unless properties.empty?
        style
      end

      # :call-seq:
      #    layout.styles            -> styles
      #    layout.styles(**mapping)   -> styles
      #
      # Returns the mapping of style names to Layout::Style instances. If +mapping+ is provided,
      # also defines the given styles using #style.
      #
      # The argument +mapping+ needs to be a hash mapping a style name (a Symbol) to style
      # properties. The special key +:base+ can be used to define the base style. For details see
      # #style.
      def styles(**mapping)
        mapping.each {|name, properties| style(name, **properties) } unless mapping.empty?
        @styles
      end

      # Creates an inline box for use together with text fragments.
      #
      # The +valign+ argument ist used to specify the vertical alignment of the box within the text
      # line. See HexaPDF::Layout::Line for details.
      #
      # If a box instance is provided as first argument, it is used. Otherwise the first argument
      # has to be the name of a box creation method and +args+, +kwargs+ and +block+ are passed to
      # it.
      #
      # Example:
      #
      #   layout.inline_box(:text, "Hallo")
      #   layout.inline_box(:list) {|list| list.text("Hallo") }

      # initialization method of that box class.
      #
      # If a block is provided, a ChildrenCollector is yielded and the collected children are passed
      # to the box initialization method via the :children keyword argument. There is one exception
      # to this rule in case +name+ is +base+: The provided block is passed to the initialization

      #   layout.box(:column, columns: 2, gap: 15)   # => column_box_instance
      #   layout.box(:column) do |column|            # column box with one child
      #     column.lorem_ipsum
      #   end
      #   layout.box(width: 100) do |canvas, box|
      #     canvas.line(0, 0, box.content_width, box.content_height).stroke

      #
      # +style+, +style_properties+::
      #     The text is styled using the given +style+. This can either be a style name set via
      #     #style or anything Layout::Style::create accepts. If any additional +style_properties+
      #     are specified, the style is duplicated and the additional styles are applied.
      #
      # +properties+::
      #     This can be used to set custom properties on the created text fragments. See
      #     Layout::Box#properties for details and usage.

      # Creates a HexaPDF::Layout::TextBox for the given text.
      #
      # This method is of the two main methods for creating text boxes, the other being
      # #formatted_text_box.
      #
      # +width+, +height+::
      #     The arguments +width+ and +height+ are used as constraints and are respected when
      #     fitting the box. The default value of 0 means that no constraints are set.
      #
      # +style+, +style_properties+::
      #     The box and the text are styled using the given +style+. This can either be a style name
      #     set via #style or anything Layout::Style::create accepts. If any additional
      #     +style_properties+ are specified, the style is duplicated and the additional styles are
      #     applied.
      #
      # +properties+::
      #     This can be used to set custom properties on the created text box. See
      #     Layout::Box#properties for details and usage.
      #
      # +box_style+::
      #     Sometimes it is necessary for the box to have a different style than the text, e.g. when
      #     using overlays. In such a case use +box_style+ for specifiying the style of the box (a
      #     style name set via #style or anything Layout::Style::create accepts).
      #
      #     The +style+ together with the +style_properties+ will be used for the text style.
      #
      # Examples:
      #
      #   layout.text_box("Test is on " * 15)
      #   layout.text_box("Now " * 7, width: 100)
      #   layout.text_box("Another test", font_size: 15, fill_color: "hp-blue")
      #   layout.text_box("Different box style", fill_color: 'white', box_style: {
      #     underlays: [->(c, b) { c.rectangle(0, 0, b.content_width, b.content_height).fill }]

      # Creates a HexaPDF::Layout::TextBox like #text_box but allows parts of the text to be
      # formatted differently.
      #
      # The argument +data+ needs to be an array of String, HexaPDF::Layout::InlineBox and/or Hash
      # objects and is transformed so that it is suitable as argument for the text box
      # initialization method.
      #
      # * A String object is treated like {text: data}.
      #
      # * A HexaPDF::Layout::InlineBox is used without modification.
      #
      # * Hashes can contain any style properties and the following special keys:
      #
      #   text:: The text to be formatted. If this is set and :box is not, the hash will be
      #          transformed into text fragments.
      #
      #   link:: A URL that should be linked to. If no text is provided but a link, the link is used
      #          for the text. If this is set and :box is not, the hash will be transformed into
      #          text fragments with an appropriate link overlay.
      #
      #   style:: The style to use as base style instead of the style created from the +style+ and
      #           +style_properties+ arguments. This can either be a style name set via #style or
      #           anything HexaPDF::Layout::Style::create allows.
      #
      #           If any style properties are set, the used style is duplicated and the additional
      #           properties applied.
      #
      #           The final style is used for a created text fragment.
      #
      #   properties:: The custom properties that should be set on the created text fragments.
      #
      #   box:: An inline box to be used. If this is set, the hash will be transformed into an
      #         inline box.
      #
      #         The value must be one or more (as an array) positional arguments to be used with the
      #         #inline_box method. The rest of the hash keys are passed as keyword arguments to
      #         #inline_box except for :block which would be passed as the block.

      #
      # In addition to everything the table box implementation allows for +data+, it is also

      # header and footer!
      #
      # Additional arguments for the #text_box invocations can be specified using the optional block
      # that yields a CellArgumentCollector instance. This allows customization of the text boxes.
      # By specifying the special key +:cell+ it is also possible to assign style properties to the
      # cells themselves, irrespective of the type of content of the cells. See
      # CellArgumentCollector#[]= for details.
