module HexaPDF

  # Manages the revisions of a PDF document.
  #
  # A PDF document has one revision when it is created. Later, new revisions are added when changes
  # are made. This allows for adding information/content to a PDF file without changing the original
  # content.
  #
  # The order of the revisions is important. In HexaPDF the oldest revision always has index 0 and
  # the newest revision the highest index. This is also the order in which the revisions get
  # written.
  #
  # *Important*: It is possible to manipulate the individual revisions and their objects oneself but
  # this should only be done if one is familiar with the inner workings of HexaPDF. Otherwise it is
  # best to use the convenience methods of this class to create, access or delete indirect objects.
  #
  # See: PDF2.0 s7.5.6, HexaPDF::Revision
