  # == Overview
  #
  # A stream filter is used to compress a stream or to encode it in an ASCII compatible way; or
  # to reverse this process. Some filters can be used for any content, like FlateDecode, others
  # are specifically designed for image streams, like DCTDecode.
  #
  # Each filter is implemented via fibers. This allows HexaPDF to easily process either small
  # chunks or a whole stream at once, depending on the memory restrictions and to create flexible
  # filter pipelines.
  #
  # It also allows the easy re-processing of a stream without first decoding and the encoding it.
  # Such functionality is useful, for example, when a PDF file should be decrypted and streams
  # compressed in one step.
  #
  #
  # == Implementation of a Filter Object
  #
  # Each filter is an object (normally a module) that responds to two methods: \#encoder and
  # \#decoder. Both of these methods are given a *source* (a Fiber) and *options* (a Hash) and have
  # to return a Fiber object.
  #
  # The returned fiber should resume the *source* fiber to get the next chunk of binary data
  # (possibly only one byte of data, so this situation should be handled gracefully). Once the
  # fiber has processed this chunk, it should yield the processed chunk as binary string. This
  # should be done as long as the source fiber is #alive? and doesn't return +nil+ when resumed.
  #
  # Such a fiber should *not* return +nil+ unless this signifies that no more data is coming!
  #
  # See: PDF1.7 s7.4
