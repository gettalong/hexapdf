  module Task

    # Task for merging an AcroForm from one PDF into another.
    #
    # It takes care of
    #
    # * adding the fields to the main Type::AcroForm::Form dictionary,
    # * adjusting the field names so that they are unique,
    # * and merging the properties of the main AcroForm dictionary itself and adjusting field
    #   information appropriately.
    #
    # Note that the pages with the fields need to be imported already.
    #
    # The steps for using this task are:
    #
    # 1. Import the pages into the target document and add all imported pages to an array
    # 2. Call this task using the created array of pages.
    #
    # Example:
    #
    #   pages = doc.pages.map {|page| target.pages.add(target.import(page)) }
    #   target.task(:merge_acro_form, source: doc, pages: pages)
