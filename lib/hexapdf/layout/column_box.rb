    # A ColumnBox arranges boxes in one or more columns.
    #
    # The number and width of the columns as well as the size of the gap between the columns can be
    # modified. Additionally, the contents can either fill the columns one after the other or the
    # columns can be made equally high.
    #
    # If the column box has padding and/or borders specified, they are handled like with any other
    # box. This means they are around all columns and their contents and are not used separately for
    # each column.
    #
    # The following style properties are used (additionally to those used by the parent class):
    #
    # Style#position::
    #    If this is set to :flow, the frames created for the columns will take the shape of the
    #    frame into account. This also means that the +available_width+ and +available_height+
    #    arguments are ignored.
    class ColumnBox < Box

      # The child boxes of this ColumnBox. They need to be finalized before #fit is called.
      attr_reader :children

      # The columns definition.
      #
      # If the value is an array, it needs to contain the widths of the columns. The size of the
      # array determines the number of columns. Otherwise, if the value is an integer, the value
      # defines the number of equally sized columns, i.e. a value of +N+ is equal to [-1]*N.
      #
      # If a negative integer is used for the width, the column is auto-sized. Such columns split
      # the remaining width (after substracting the widths of the fixed columns) proportionally
      # among them. For example, if the definition is [-1, -2, -2], the first column is a fifth of
      # the width and the other columns are each two fifth of the width.
      #
      # Examples:
      #
      #   #>pdf-composer
      #   composer.box(:column, columns: 2, gaps: 10,
      #                children: [composer.document.layout.lorem_ipsum_box])
      #

      #
      #   #>pdf-composer
      #   composer.box(:column, columns: [50, -2, -1], gaps: [10, 5],
      #                children: [composer.document.layout.lorem_ipsum_box])
      attr_reader :columns

      # The size of the gaps between the columns.
      #
      # This is an array containing the width of the gaps. If there are more gaps than numbers in
      # the array, the array is cycled.
      #
      # Examples: see #columns
      attr_reader :gaps

      # Determines whether the columns should all be equally high or not.
      #
      # Examples:
      #

      #   composer.box(:column, children: [composer.document.layout.lorem_ipsum_box])
