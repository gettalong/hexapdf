    # A TableBox allows placing boxes in a table.
    #
    # A table box instance can be fit into a rectangular area. The widths of the columns is
    # determined by the #column_widths definition. This means that there is no auto-sizing
    # supported.
    #
    # If some rows don't fit into the provided area, the table is split. The style of the original
    # table is also applied to the split box.
    #
    #
    # == Table Cell
    #
    # Each table cell is a Box instance and can have an associated style, e.g. for creating borders
    # around the cell contents. It is also possible to create cells that span more than one row or
    # column. By default a cell has a solid, black, 1pt border and a padding of 5pt on all sides.
    #
    # It is important to note that the drawing of cell borders (just the drawing, size calculations
    # are done as usual) are handled differently from standard box borders. While standard box
    # borders are drawn inside the box, cell borders are drawn on the bounds of the box. This means
    # that, visually, the borders of adjoining cells overlap, with the borders of cells to the right
    # and bottom being on top.
    #
    # To make sure that the cell borders are not outside of the table's bounds, the left and top
    # border widths of the top-left cell and the right and bottom border widths of the bottom-right
    # cell are taken into account when calculating the available space.
    #
    #
    # == Examples
    #
    # Let's start with a basic table:
    #
    #  #>pdf-composer
    #  cells = [[layout.text('A'), layout.text('B')],
    #           [layout.text('C'), layout.text('D')]]
    #  composer.table(cells)
    #
    # The HexaPDF::Document::Layout#table_box method accepts the cells as positional argument
    # instead of as keyword argument but all other arguments of ::new work the same.
    #
    # While the table box itself only allows box instances as cell contents, the layout helper
    # method also allows text which it transforms to text boxes. So this is the same as the above:
    #
    #  #>pdf-composer
    #  composer.table([['A', 'B'], ['C', 'D']])
    #
    # The style of the cells can be customized, e.g. to avoid drawing borders:
    #
    #  #>pdf-composer
    #  cells = [[layout.text('A'), layout.text('B')],
    #           [layout.text('C'), layout.text('D')]]
    #  composer.table(cells, cell_style: {border: {width: 0}})
    #
    # If the table doesn't fit completely, it is automatically split (in this case, the last row
    # gets moved to the second column):
    #
    #  #>pdf-composer
    #  cells = [[layout.text('A'), layout.text('B')],
    #           [layout.text('C'), layout.text('D')],
    #           [layout.text('E'), layout.text('F')]]
    #  composer.column(height: 50) {|col| col.table(cells) }
    #
    # It is also possible to use row and column spans:
    #
    #  #>pdf-composer
    #  cells = [[{content: layout.text('A'), col_span: 2}, {content: layout.text('B'), row_span: 2}],
    #           [{content: layout.text('C'), col_span: 2, row_span: 2}],
    #           [layout.text('D')]]
    #  composer.table(cells)
    #
    # Each table can have header rows and footer rows which are shown for all split parts:
    #
    #  #>pdf-composer
    #  header = lambda {|tb| [[{content: layout.text('Header', text_align: :center), col_span: 2}]] }
    #  footer = lambda {|tb| [[layout.text('left'), layout.text('right', text_align: :right)]] }
    #  cells = [[layout.text('A'), layout.text('B')],
    #           [layout.text('C'), layout.text('D')],
    #           [layout.text('E'), layout.text('F')]]
    #  composer.column(height: 90) {|col| col.table(cells, header: header, footer: footer) }
    #
    # The cells can be styled using a callable object for more complex styling:
    #
    #  #>pdf-composer
    #  cells = [[layout.text('A'), layout.text('B')],
    #           [layout.text('C'), layout.text('D')]]
    #  block = lambda do |cell|
    #    cell.style.background_color =
    #      (cell.row == 0 && cell.column == 0 ? 'ffffaa' : 'ffffee')
    #  end
    #  composer.table(cells, cell_style: block)
    class TableBox < Box

      # Represents a single cell of the table.
      #
      # A cell is a container box that fits and draws its children with a BoxFitter. Its dimensions
      # (width and height) are not determined by its children but by the table layout algorithm.
      # Furthermore, its style can be used for drawing e.g. a cell border.

      # borders that do not overlap.

      # Represents the cells of a TableBox.
      #
      # This class is a wrapper around an array of arrays and provides some utility methods for
      # managing and styling the cells.
      #
      # == Table data transformation into correct form
      #
      # One of the main purposes of this class is to transform the cell data provided on
      # initialization into the representation a TableBox instance can work with.
      #
      # The +data+ argument for ::new is an array of arrays representing the rows of the table. Each
      # row array may contain one of the following items:
      #
      # * A single Box instance defining the content of the cell.
      #
      # * An array of Box instances defining the content of the cell.
      #
      # * A hash which defines the content of the cell as well as, optionally, additional
      #   information through the following keys:
      #
      #   +:content+:: The content for the cell. This may be a single Box or an array of Box
      #                instances.
      #
      #   +:row_span+:: An integer specifying the number of rows this cell should span.
      #
      #   +:col_span+:: An integer specifying the number of columsn this cell should span.
      #
      #   +:properties+:: A hash of properties (see Box#properties) to be set on the cell itself.
      #
      #   All other key-value pairs are taken to be cell styling information (like
      #   +:background_color+) and assigned to the cell style.
      #
      # Additionally, the first item in the +data+ argument is treated specially if it is not an
      # array:
      #
      # * If it is a hash, it is assumed to be style properties to be set on all created cell
      #   instances.
      #
      # * If it is a callable object, it needs to accept a cell as argument and is called for all
      #   created cell instances.
      #
      # Any properties or styling information retrieved from the respective item in +data+ takes
      # precedence over the above globally specified information.
      #
      # Here is an example input data array:
      #
      #  data = [[box1, {col_span: 2, content: box2}, box3],
      #          [box4, box5, {col_span: 2, row_span: 2, content: [box6.1, box6.2]}],
      #          [box7, box8]]
      #
      # And this is what the table will look like:
      #
      #  | box1 | box2         | box 3 |
      #  | box4 | box5 | box6.1 box6.2 |
      #  | box7 | box8 |               |
      class Cells

        # Creates a new Cells instance with the given +data+ which cannot be changed afterwards.
        #
        # The optional +cell_style+ argument can either be a hash of style properties to be assigned
        # to every cell or a block accepting a cell for more control over e.g. style assignment. If
        # the +data+ has such a cell style as its first item, the +cell_style+ argument is not used.
