  # Container for stream data that is more complex than a string.
  #
  # This helper class wraps all information necessary to read stream data by using a Fiber object
  # (see HexaPDF::Filter). The underlying data either comes from an IO object, a file represented by
  # its file name or a Fiber defined via a Proc object.
  #
  # Additionally, the #filter and #decode_parms can be set to indicate that the data returned from
  # the Fiber needs to be post-processed. The +filter+ and +decode_parms+ are automatically
  # normalized to arrays on assignment to ease further processing.

    #   StreamData.new { block }    -> stream_data
    #
    # Creates a new StreamData object for the given +source+ and with the given options.
    #
    # The +source+ can be:
    #
    # * An IO stream which is read starting from a specific +offset+ for a specific +length+
    #
    # * A string which is interpreted as a file name and read starting from a specific +offset+
    # * and for a specific +length+
    #
    # * A Proc object (that is converted to a Fiber when needed) in which case the +offset+ and
    #   value is ignored. The Proc object can also be passed by using a block.

  # == Stream Objects
  #
  # A stream may also be associated with a PDF object but only if the value is a PDF dictionary.
  # This associated dictionary further describes the stream, like its length or how it is encoded.
  #
  # Such a stream object in PDF contains string data but of possibly unlimited length. Therefore
  # it is used for large amounts of data like images, page descriptions or embedded files.
  #
  # The basic Object class cannot hold stream data, only this subclass contains the necessary
  # methods to conveniently work with the stream data!
  #
  # Note that support for external streams (/F, /FFilter, /FDecodeParms) is not yet implemented!
  #
