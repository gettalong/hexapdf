    # Splits a PDF file, putting each page into a separate file.

          The default strategy is to split a PDF into individual pages, i.e. splitting is done by
          page number. It is also possible to split by page size where pages with the same page size
          get put into the same output PDF.

          If no OUTPUT_SPEC is specified, the resulting PDF files are named <PDF>_0001.pdf,
          <PDF>_0002.pdf, ... when splitting by page number and <PDF>_A4.pdf, <PDF>_Letter.pdf, ...
          when splitting by page size.

          To specify a custom name, provide the OUTPUT_SPEC argument. It can contain a printf-style
          format definition like '%04d' to specify the place where the page number should be
          inserted. In case of splitting by page size, the place of the format defintion is replaced
          with the name of the page size, e.g. A4 or Letter.

          The optimization and encryption options are applied to each created output file.
