          This command uses one ore more pages from a PDF file and applies them as background or
          stamp on another PDF file.

          If multiple pages are selected from the watermark PDF, the --repeat option can be used to
          specify how they should be applied: 'last' (the default) will only repeat the last
          watermark page whereas 'all' will cyclically repeat all watermark pages.
