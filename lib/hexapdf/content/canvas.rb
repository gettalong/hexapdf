    # This class provides the basic drawing operations supported by PDF.
    #
    # == General Information
    #
    # A canvas object is used for modifying content streams on a level higher than text. It would
    # be possible to write a content stream by hand since PDF uses a simplified reversed polish
    # notation for specifying operators: First come the operands, then comes the operator and no
    # operator returns any result. However, it is easy to make mistakes this way and one has to
    # know all operators and their operands.
    #
    # This is rather tedious and therefore this class exists. It allows one to modify a content
    # stream by invoking methods that should be familiar to anyone that has ever used a graphic
    # API. There are methods for moving the current point, drawing lines and curves, setting the
    # color, line width and so on.
    #
    # The PDF operators themselves are implemented as classes, see Operator. The canvas class uses
    # the Operator::BaseOperator#invoke and Operator::BaseOperator#serialize methods for applying
    # changes and serialization, with one exception: color setters don't invoke the corresponding
    # operator implementation but directly work on the graphics state.
    #
    #
    # == PDF Graphics
    #
    # === Graphics Operators and Objects
    #
    # There are about 60 PDF content stream operators. Some are used for changing the graphics
    # state, some for drawing paths and others for showing text. This is all abstracted through
    # the Canvas class.
    #
    # PDF knows about five different graphics objects: path objects, text objects, external
    # objects, inline image objects and shading objects. If none of the five graphics objects is
    # current, the content stream is at the so called page description level (in between graphics
    # objects).
    #
    # Additionally the PDF operators are divided into several groups, like path painting or text
    # showing operators, and such groups of operators are allowed to be used only in certain
    # graphics objects or the page description level.
    #
    # Have a look at the PDF specification (PDF1.7 s8.2) for more details.
    #
    # HexaPDF tries to ensure the proper use of the operators and graphics objects and if it
    # cannot do it, an error is raised. So if you don't modify a content stream directly but via
    # the Canvas methods, you generally don't have to worry about the low-level inner workings.
    #
    # === Graphics State
    #
    # Some operators modify the so called graphics state (see Content::GraphicsState). The graphics
    # state is a collection of settings that is used during processing or creating a content stream.
    # For example, the path painting operators don't have operands to specify the line width or the
    # stroke color but take this information from the graphics state.
    #
    # One important thing about the graphics state is that it is only possible to restore a prior
    # state using the save and restore methods. It is not possible to reset the graphics state
    # while creating the content stream!
    #
    # === Paths
    #
    # A PDF path object consists of one or more subpaths. Each subpath can be a rectangle or can
    # consist of lines and cubic bezier curves. No other types of subpaths are known to PDF.
    # However, the Canvas class contains additional methods that use the basic path construction
    # methods for drawing other paths like circles.
    #
    # When a subpath is started, the current graphics object is changed to :path. After all path
    # constructions are finished, a path painting method needs to be invoked to change back to the
    # page description level. Optionally, the path painting method may be preceeded by a clipping
    # path method to change the current clipping path (see #clip_path).
    #
    # There are four kinds of path painting methods:
    #
    # * Those that stroke the path,
    # * those that fill the path,
    # * those that stroke and fill the path and
    # * one to neither stroke or fill the path (used, for example, to just set the clipping path).
    #
    # In addition filling may be done using either the nonzero winding number rule or the even-odd
    # rule.
    #
    #
    # == Special Graphics State Methods
    #
    # These methods are only allowed when the current graphics object is :none, i.e. operations are
    # done on the page description level.
    #
    # * #save_graphics_state
    # * #restore_graphics_state
    # * #transform, #rotate, #scale, #translate, #skew

      # * A color object is used directly (normally used for color spaces other than DeviceRGB,

      # * An array is treated as if its items were specified separately as arguments.

      # A marked-content sequence is used to identify a sequence of complete graphics objects in the
