module HexaPDF

  # Implementation of the PDF dictionary type.
  #
  # Subclasses should use the available class method ::define_field to create fields according to
  # the PDF specification. This allows, among other things, automatic type checking and
  # basic validation.
  #
  # Fields defined in superclasses are inherited by their subclasses. This avoids duplicating
  # basic field information.
  #
  # See: PDF1.7 s7.3.7
  class Dictionary < HexaPDF::Object

    include DictionaryFields

    # Defines an entry for the field +name+ and returns the initalized
    # HexaPDF::DictionaryFields::Field object. A suitable converter module (see
    # HexaPDF::DictionaryFields::Field#converter) is selected based on the type argument.
    #
    # Options:
    #
    # type:: The class (or an array of classes) that a value of this field must have. Here is a
    #        mapping from PDF object types to classes:
    #
    #        Boolean::    \[TrueClass, FalseClass] (or use the Boolean constant)
    #        Integer::    Integer
    #        Real::       Float
    #        String::     String (for text strings), PDFByteString (for binary strings)
    #        Date::       PDFDate
    #        Name::       Symbol
    #        Array::      PDFArray or Array
    #        Dictionary:: Dictionary (or any subclass) or Hash
    #        Stream::     Stream (or any subclass)
    #        Null::       NilClass
    #
    #        If an array of classes is provided, the value can be an instance of any of these
    #        classes.
    #
    #        If a Symbol object instead of a class is provided, the class is looked up using the
    #        'object.type_map' global configuration option when necessary to support lazy loading.
    #
    #        Note that if multiple types are allowed and one of the allowed types is Dictionary (or
    #        a Symbol), it has to be the first in the list. Otherwise automatic type conversion
    #        functions won't work correctly.
    #
    # required:: Specifies whether this field is required.
    #
    # default:: Specifies the default value for the field, if any.
    #
    # indirect:: Specifies whether the value (or the values in the array value) of this field has
    #            to be an indirect object (+true+), a direct object (+false+) or if it doesn't
    #            matter (unspecified or +nil+).
    #
    # allowed_values:: An array of allowed values for this field.
    #
    # version:: Specifies the minimum version of the PDF specification needed for this value.

    # This method should be used instead of direct access to the value because it provides
    # numerous advantages:
    #
    # * References are automatically resolved.
    #
    # * Returns the native Ruby object for values with class HexaPDF::Object. However, all
    #   subclasses of HexaPDF::Object are returned as is (it makes no sense, for example, to return
    #   the hash that describes the Catalog instead of the Catalog object).
    #
    # * Automatically wraps hash values in specific subclasses of this class if field information is
    #   available (see ::define_field).
    #
    # * Returns the default value if one is specified and no value is available.
    #
    # Note: If field information is available for the entry, a Hash or Array value will always be
    # wrapped by Dictionary or PDFArray. Otherwise, the value will be returned as-is.
    #
    # Note: This method may throw a "can't add a new key into hash during iteration" error in
    # certain cases because it potentially modifies the underlying hash!
